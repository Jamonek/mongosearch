About
=====
MongoSearch is a very basic full-text search engine that uses MongoDB. It is
more of a proof-of-concept than anything else, and should certainly not be seen
as a proper alternative to "real" search engines such as Solr and Lucene.

Dependencies
============
* PyMongo
* MongoEngine (>=0.3)
* PyStemmer
* lxml
* feedparser (for running the example)
