<p>My thanks to TheNextTrain for sponsoring this week&#8217;s DF RSS feed. TheNextTrain is an iPhone app for commuter rail passengers. It has offline train schedules for rail systems in 16 regions across the U.S. and Canada, including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco &#8212; along with maps for most of them. Completely replaces the need to carry paper train schedules.</p>

<p>Excellent, must-read piece by <a href="http://macjournals.com/">MDJ</a>&#8217;s Matt Deatherage, reprinted at Macworld:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Analysts: you may only get one shot at asking questions, so I&#8217;m
  here to help you with the do’s and don’ts of the conference
  call. I don’t have all the answers, but I haven’t missed one
  of these calls in nearly 14 years, so I have some experience. Our
  interests are temporarily aligned here—we all want more
  information from Apple, without spooking the executives so they
  run away from your questions. Here’s the basic map for the
  January 2010 conference call.</p>

<p>After looking at the paint-splattered invitation design, a few DF readers have emailed me with the same idea Cabel Sasser tweeted on Monday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regarding the Apple invite, and just throwing this out there: what
  if it&#8217;s called &#8220;Canvas&#8221;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even without considering the invitation design, I love this name. It looks good, it sounds good, and it evokes the right feelings and ideas: <em>thin, light, clean, crisp, blank, the thing great artwork is made upon.</em> It&#8217;s a perfect name.</p>

<p>From Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Development Kit terms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Active content will be available to customers in the Kindle Store
  later this year. Your active content can be priced three ways:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Free — Active content applications that are smaller than 1MB and
  use less than 100 KB/user/month of wireless data may be offered at
  no charge to customers. Amazon will pay the wireless costs
  associated with delivery and maintenance.</p></li>
  <li><p>One-time Purchase — Customers will be charged once when purchasing
  active content. Content must have nominal (less than 100
  KB/user/month) ongoing wireless usage.</p></li>
  <li><p>Monthly Subscription — Customers will be charged once per month
  for active content.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So for free and one-time-charge apps, there&#8217;s a monthly limit of 100 <em>kilobytes</em> of bandwidth. Go over that and the <em>developer</em> has to start paying the bill. As point of reference for just how small 100 KB is, the Daring Fireball RSS feed at this moment is 115 KB. With gzip compression, it shrinks to 36 KB. So even with compression, a free or one-time-charge Kindle app could only download the DF RSS feed twice per month without going over.</p>

<p>Torsten Curdt has released an open source variation on the idea behind the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/s/netshare">late great NetShare</a>. <a href="http://vafer.org/blog/20100120001443">Writes Curdt</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iProxy is not as convenient as the real tethering. The internet
  connection is a few clicks more away. But if you’ve got a
  developer certificate (or have a friend that has one) it
  certainly is cheaper than handing out the money to your favorite
  telco. Especially if you only need this connection only every now
  and then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only those with iPhone developer accounts can make use of it, alas, because for obvious reasons it can&#8217;t be distributed through the App Store.</p>

<summary type="html">So of course Apple is going to negotiate with Microsoft.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Interesting story from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2010/tc20100119_759795.htm">Peter Burrows and Cliff Edwards at BusinessWeek</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is in talks with Microsoft to replace Google as the default
  search engine on its iPhone, according to two people familiar with
  the matter. The talks have been under way for weeks, say the
  people, who asked not to be named because the details have not
  been made public.</p>
  
  <p>The discussions reflect the accelerating rivalry between Apple and
  Google, now the main provider of Web search on the iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later in the day, Yukari Kane and Ethan Smith at the <a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;um=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=apple+new+money+in+old+media+yukari+kane">Wall Street Journal reported similar news</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple&#8217;s divide with Google over how it views media content also
  drives the wedge deeper between the two companies. Apple&#8217;s iPhone,
  for example, currently closely integrates Google&#8217;s mapping and
  search technology, but a person familiar with the matter said
  Apple was in serious discussions with Microsoft Corp. to
  incorporate its Bing search engine into the iPhone as the default
  search and map technologies. Microsoft declined to comment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No doubt the discussions do reflect the growing Apple-Google rivalry. Google is now clearly in the mobile phone business, and Apple just <a href="http://www.quattrowireless.com/mobile_insight/blog/happy_new_year_from_quattro_wireless/">bought a mobile advertising company Quattro Wireless</a>.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s another angle here, besides the Apple-Google rivalry. Default search is important. It&#8217;s worth tens of millions of dollars per year for desktop Safari. (An informed source <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/wwdc_2007_keynote">in June 2007 told me</a> Google was then paying Apple around $2 million per month for its placement as the default search provider for desktop Safari.) Surely it&#8217;s worth millions per year for the iPhone as well. Probably a lot of millions. And the way the iPhone platform is growing, well, you get the picture.</p>

<p>And, in addition to monetary concerns, it&#8217;s an important feature. People use their iPhones to search the web, and most of them surely use the built-in search field in MobileSafari. The quality of the results is important.</p>

<p>Say what you want about Microsoft in general and Bing in particular, but the fact is, Bing is the only major competitor to Google left standing. Yahoo search is a lame duck &#8212; they&#8217;ve <a href="http://kara.allthingsd.com/20090729/complete-coverage-yahoo-microsoft-deal/">already inked the deal</a> to power it with Bing. Who else is there?</p>

<p>As I see it today, Bing is it. For that reason alone, I hope Bing does well and grows, or at least holds its own, against Google. And I obviously hope it does so by providing equally good or superior search results. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s ever healthy, in any market, for one champion to obliterate all competitors.</p>

<p>But from a practical standpoint, whether <em>Apple</em> is rooting for Bing to succeed or not, and regardless whether Apple has any actual intention of perhaps switching to Bing as the default search provider for MobileSafari and Safari, Apple almost <em>has</em> to discuss such a potential deal with Microsoft. Even if what Apple ultimately wants is to stick with Google as their default search provider, how can Apple negotiate the best possible terms from Google if they don&#8217;t have any other option? (It strikes me as very likely that even if Google remains the default search engine for iPhone OS, Bing will replace Yahoo as the second choice, which you can toggle in the Settings app.)</p>

<p>So of course Apple is going to negotiate with Microsoft. And of course Apple is going to happily leak the existence of such negotiations to the press, as we&#8217;re seeing today, because they want Google to see that they&#8217;ve got competition to be the iPhone&#8217;s search provider. It&#8217;s Negotiating 101.</p>

<p>But then here&#8217;s the really interesting part of BusinessWeek&#8217;s report, buried in the last paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if it&#8217;s consummated, an Apple-Bing deal may prove short-lived.
  The person familiar with Apple&#8217;s thinking says Apple has a &#8220;skunk
  works&#8221; looking at a search offering of its own, and believes that
  &#8220;if Apple does do a search deal with Microsoft, it&#8217;s about buying
  itself time.&#8221; Given the importance of search and its tie to mobile
  advertising &#8212; and the iPhone maker&#8217;s desire to slow Google &#8212; &#8220;Apple
  isn&#8217;t going to outsource the future.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is intriguing if true, and helps Apple&#8217;s negotiations with both Microsoft and Google even if it isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It&#8217;s worth noting that YouTube is only supporting H.264, so it only works with Safari and Chrome, not Firefox. (Firefox supports only the Ogg Theora format. Don&#8217;t hold your breath waiting for YouTube to re-encode everything in Ogg Theora.)</p>

<p>WSJ report by Yukari Kane and Ethan Smith, very light on substance but chock full of interesting rumors regarding The Tablet and deals with book, magazine, and newspaper publishers to sell content through iTunes. Also this, near the end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has also been planning a revamp of its iTunes music service
  by creating a Web-based version of it that could launch as soon as
  June, say people familiar with the matter. Tentatively called
  iTunes.com, the service would allow customers to buy music without
  going through the specialized iTunes program on computers and

<p>Remember BumpTop, the sort-of 3D desktop file manager that shipped for Windows <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/10/02/bumptop">back in October</a>? The Mac version shipped today, for $29. It&#8217;s interesting. I&#8217;ve had the beta versions for a few weeks, and I can vouch that it doesn&#8217;t feel like a Windows app ported to the Mac; it feels like a real Mac app.</p>

<p>But: I quickly realized I had no need for it. I found it fun to play with, and the &#8220;piles&#8221; idea is something that has been rumored for the Mac dating back to the aborted Copland project in the 90s &#8212; and it actually is very nice to have a way to group related file system objects together without putting them into a folder which itself is a file system object and which introduces another layer of hierarchy. The thing is, I don&#8217;t just want better file management for my <em>desktop</em>. I want better file management everywhere. BumpTop is a Finder alternative that only handles one folder: <em>~/Desktop/</em>. And the 3D stuff, with a weird perspective on &#8220;walls&#8221;, just seems silly.</p>

<p>If you spend a lot of time dealing with files and folders on your desktop, though, it&#8217;s definitely worth a look.</p>

<p>Interesting look at the subpixel design of the Nexus One display.</p>

<p>The high pixel density of the display is marvelous for reading text. Letterforms are, as you&#8217;d expect, very crisp. My biggest gripe about the Nexus One display is that certain colors are way over-saturated. All skin tones look very orange to me. Everyone gets that spray-on tan look. Reds, pinks, and especially oranges all go fluorescent. In short, I love the pixel density and brightness (and, so far, the battery life), but I do not like the color reproduction. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the nature of OLED, or if it&#8217;s specific to the Nexus One.</p>

<p>David Barnard:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While fiddling with the Nexus One last week, I was incredibly
  annoyed at how many times I accidentally tapped the Home button
  while trying to tap the space bar on the software keyboard. [&#8230;]</p>
  
  <p>While typing on the iPhone I’ve been subconsciously tapping
  slightly below the bottom row of the software keyboard because it
  requires less precision. My fingers were using that muscle memory
  while typing on the Nexus One keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same thing with me using the Nexus One. And the Home button is a particularly annoying, almost devastating button to accidentally hit by mistake: boom, you&#8217;re back at the Home screen of the system, right when you were in mid-sentence, trying to type a space. Barnard links to <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/engadget/videos/938/40">this example</a> of a Palm guy demoing the new Pre Plus making a similar mistake.</p>

<p>I think you can argue that this is a touchscreen application of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law">Fitts&#8217;s Law</a>.</p>

<p>I say no. I guess it&#8217;s not a bad name in and of itself, but it sounds and looks way too much like &#8220;iPod&#8221;. (And for what it&#8217;s worth, the &#8220;ipad.com&#8221; domain name is not <a href="http://who.is/whois/ipad.com/">registered</a> to <a href="http://www.markmonitor.com/">MarkMonitor</a>, Apple&#8217;s preferred domain registration service.)</p>

<p>I have heard nothing &#8212; zilch, zero &#8212; about the name of this thing from sources. So this is all just my opinion. If you wanted me to bet on a name, I&#8217;d say they bring back &#8220;iBook&#8221;. If so, maybe that&#8217;s the reason for the change from PowerBook and iBook to MacBook a few years ago. But that&#8217;s just a wild guess on my part, and mainly because I just think it&#8217;s a great name. Looks good, sounds good.</p>

<p>Second guess, even wilder guess: &#8220;Tablet&#8221;. Not &#8220;iTab&#8221;, not &#8220;iTablet&#8221;. I started referring to it as &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/the_tablet">The Tablet</a>&#8221; just to have something to refer to it as, and because that&#8217;s what friends at Apple (who know nothing about the specifics) seem to call the whole secret project. (A lot of people at Apple refer to the iPhone as &#8220;the phone&#8221;, too.) But just plain &#8220;Tablet&#8221; actually started growing on me. Maybe it&#8217;s time to drop the whole &#8220;i&#8221; prefix thing anyway.</p>

<p>This stuff about avoiding or abandoning IE6 is foolish. Everyone should abandon IE, period. These security problems will never end. How many strikes do they get before they&#8217;re out?</p>

<p>Also, if it&#8217;s true that Internet Explorer played some role in the Chinese security intrusion against Google, it raises the question of why in the world anyone at Google is using IE. What&#8217;s up with that?</p>

<p>Chris Foresman, on a new report from Gartner on mobile app sales:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Earlier this month, Apple announced that sales had topped 3
  billion; that means iPhone users downloaded 2.5 billion apps in
  2009 alone. Gartner&#8217;s figures show another 16 million apps that
  could come from other platforms&#8217; recently opened app stores,
  giving Apple at least 99.4 percent of all mobile apps sold for
  the year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Foresman is wrong here. Apple didn&#8217;t announce 3 billion App Store <em>sales</em>; they announced 3 billion <em>downloads</em>, including free apps. Apple has never (to my knowledge) publicly revealed the breakdown between free and paid app downloads from the App Store.</p>

<p>However, if Gartner is correct that all other platforms <em>combined</em> accounted for only 16 million mobile app sales last year, then Apple&#8217;s share of the market is astonishingly high. It&#8217;s not 99.4 percent, as Foresman indicates, but still crazy-ass high.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Via email, Chris Foresman informs me that Gartner has clarified for him that their figures are indeed estimates of all apps <em>downloaded</em> for any platform in 2009, free or paid. In other words, Gartner is using the word &#8220;sale&#8221; to mean &#8220;download&#8221;, probably because that appeals to their market. So Gartner really is claiming that Apple has <em>over 99 percent</em> of the mobile app market. Wow.</p>

<p>Love this bit from page four, on why people love to save files to their desktops:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason is simple: the desktop is the one &#8220;place&#8221; on the
  computer that every user knows how to get to. People don&#8217;t even
  think of it as existing in the file hierarchy (though, of course,
  it does); to them it&#8217;s a <em>location</em> in the physical sense, and
  items placed within it behave almost as if they were real objects.
  A file can be &#8220;lost&#8221; in the file hierarchy &#8212; irretrievably, as
  far as novice users are concerned &#8212; but finding something on the
  desktop will never be any worse than rummaging through the
  messiest real-life junk drawer. And that bargain, that task of
  keeping things neat by placing, removing, and arranging, is
  something that people are comfortable with, and that their innate
  human abilities are tailored for.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t follow me on Twitter, I switched, cold turkey, to a Nexus One on Friday. (I borrowed it from <a href="http://appcubby.com/">App Cubby developer David Barnard</a>, who was kind enough to lend it to me for a few weeks.) I&#8217;ve been tweeting some initial observations, and eventually plan to write a full review/comparison to the iPhone.</p>

<p>As a snapshot, though, I can think of no better example to epitomize the difference between Android and iPhone OS than Advanced Task Killer, a third-party Android app. That this app even exists is, on the one hand, exactly what many Android fans like about Android, and on the other hand exactly what many iPhone fans see as wrong about Android. The truth is you do not need this app (or anything like it) for Android, but many Android users <em>want</em> it.</p>

<summary type="html">Looking back at Apple&apos;s Newton.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>I enjoyed <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/events/ces2010.asp">Paul Thurrott&#8217;s daily coverage of CES last week</a>. A big trade show is a hard thing to capture in prose, and Thurrott got it.</p>

<p>But I chuckled at this piece starting his CES coverage, &#8220;<a href="http://community.winsupersite.com/blogs/paul/archive/2010/01/06/exclusive-microsoft-to-announce-tablet-pc-before-apple.aspx">Exclusive! Microsoft to Announce Tablet PC Before Apple!</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The tech industry is tripping over itself to promote Apple&#8217;s
  maybe-it-is-maybe-it-isn&#8217;t Tablet computing device, but Microsoft
  has their number: I can now reveal that Microsoft and its PC maker
  partners will announce and then deliver their own Tablet PC well
  before Apple. And I have an exclusive photo of a prototype of this
  unbelievable, trend-setting, and innovative product…</p>
  
  <p>… from 2001. The devices shipped in 2002. Almost eight years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The punchline being that Microsoft&#8217;s 2001 Tablet PC initiative was the forebear to whatever it is that Apple seems poised to unveil, and Microsoft isn&#8217;t getting its due credit for this trailblazing effort. This is funny in two ways. First, however misguided much of the pre-announcement hype for the Apple tablet is, I haven&#8217;t seen <em>anyone</em> argue that tablet computers don&#8217;t already exist. The hype isn&#8217;t about Apple possibly unveiling the first tablet computing device; it&#8217;s about Apple possibly unveiling the first <em>great</em> one. I imagine Thurrott as a film critic in 1968, irritated at the hype surrounding Kubrick&#8217;s <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> on the grounds that Ed Wood made <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052077/">Plan 9 From Outer Space</a></em> nine years earlier.</p>

<p>Second, even if you&#8217;re only concerned about who was first, shouldn&#8217;t that credit go to <em>Apple</em>, for the Newton MessagePad that first shipped in 1993?</p>

<p>Thinking of the Newton got my gears turning. It&#8217;s a fascinating comparison point for both the iPhone and whatever it is Apple is set to release. I suspect most of you reading this have never used, let alone owned, a Newton, which is a shame. They really were remarkable, innovative devices.</p>

<p>Our &#8220;desktop&#8221; computers&#8217; human interfaces haven&#8217;t fundamentally changed since 1984 &#8212; keyboard and mouse/trackpad for input, overlapping draggable resizable  windows on-screen, and a hierarchical file system where you create and manage &#8220;document files&#8221;. Have you ever sat back, scratched your chin, and wondered when the computer industry will break free of these current interfaces &#8212; which can be a hassle even for experts, <a href="http://www.marco.org/318091966">and downright confusing</a> (e.g. click vs. double-click) for the non-experts? Surely no one expects the computer interfaces of, say, 50 years hence to be based on these same metaphors and input methods. What&#8217;s the next step?</p>

<p>The Newton was Apple&#8217;s first answer to that. The Newton used new metaphors, and in many ways, better abstractions than the Mac. We sort of take it for granted with many apps today (including good web apps) that you don&#8217;t have to explicitly save changes, and that you don&#8217;t have to pick a unique name and directory path for each new thing you create. The Newton was there in 1993, system-wide. &#8220;Newton&#8221; was even a great name. Newtons were always <em>less than</em> Macs in terms of raw performance and software capabilities (there was never even a Newton with a color display), but at the height of Newton-mania (such that it was), which peaked while the Mac was at its technical nadir, you could squint your eyes and envision a future where the Newton UI paradigms would form the basis of Apple&#8217;s future flagship computers (and, then, inevitably, everyone else&#8217;s). Not the Newton as it was, but the Newton as it could have eventually become.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve long pondered why the Newton failed. I think it defies any simple explanation. Its problems and shortcomings were multivariate &#8212; it was a confluence of factors that led to it never really taking off. Ultimately the entire Newton product line was killed by Steve Jobs when he returned to the helm at Apple. I, among many others, would argue that the Newton could have still been saved. It certainly never flourished, but it wasn&#8217;t a total market failure, either. And Palm&#8217;s success in the 1990s proved that there was a market.</p>

<p>I <em>would</em> argue, though, that there was no chance for the Newton to be saved under Steve Jobs. The whole thing was created during Jobs&#8217;s exile from Apple. I&#8217;d go so far as to hold up the Newton as the epitome of the Steve-Jobs-less Apple, both good and bad. That Apple was undeniably different in certain fundamental ways than Jobs&#8217;s new Apple. I don&#8217;t see Jobs as a Midas-type who can turn anything he touches into gold. His gifts are for leading the creation of tech products from conception onward, not for taking products created by others and fixing them. Some devoted Newton users suspected spite in Jobs&#8217;s decision to kill it &#8212; the Newton having been John Sculley&#8217;s baby &#8212; but I think it was more basic than that: he truly disliked it. Nothing good comes of Apple products that Jobs doesn&#8217;t like.</p>

<h2>What Sunk the Newton</h2>

<p>MessagePads were small compared to laptops (especially the laptops of the mid-’90s), but they weren&#8217;t pocket-sized. Palm Pilots were. Newtons typically cost around $800-900. Palm Pilots cost about $300-400. The price alone didn&#8217;t doom the Newton &#8212; plenty of successful gadgets cost much more than that. The problem was that it was hard to make the case in a nutshell why the Newton was worth that much.</p>

<p>The original Palm Pilot didn&#8217;t ship until 1996, three years after the original Newton. So it&#8217;s not like side-by-side competition with the Palm Pilot led to the Newton&#8217;s demise from the get-go. But the Palm Pilot&#8217;s success shows the direction Apple should have moved after the Newton&#8217;s 1993 debut: smaller and cheaper. Instead, they kept the size and price the same, and expanded its features and performance. If Apple had shipped a Newton OS device the size of a Palm Pilot for $400 by 1995, the world might be a very different place today. (If the Newton had been a hit, Apple wouldn&#8217;t have been in such trouble in 1996, and might not have bought NeXT, in which case Jobs never would have returned to the company.)</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s OK for a 1.0 product to be ahead of its time, to be too ambitious. The trick is not to be <em>too</em> far ahead, and more importantly, for the follow-up products to improve practically. The Newton kept improving year after year, but not in the right direction. It kept growing in ambition. Compare and contrast with the iPhone. The changes from the original iPhone to today&#8217;s 3GS have been incremental and focused on practical concerns: performance, storage capacity, and price. Refinement, not feature creep.</p>

<p>The Newton was a pre-Internet concept that debuted at the start of the Internet revolution. All modern computers are now seen as communication devices. The Newton wasn&#8217;t designed around that. I&#8217;m not arguing that Apple should have somehow invented Wi-Fi in 1993, but rather that the lack of any wireless IP networking was the biggest factor that kept the whole concept from being compelling to enough people to make it a hit. The Palm Pilot wasn&#8217;t any more of an Internet device when it debuted, but it didn&#8217;t have to be, because it cost less.</p>

<p>The Newton had incredible technology. But there&#8217;s a big difference between something that works well and something that&#8217;s amazing only insofar as that it works at all. The nutshell memory everyone has of the Newton is its flawed handwriting recognition, famously mocked by both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Newton_eat_up_martha.jpg">The Simpsons</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/18/business/doonesbury-and-apple-hatch-a-comic-surprise.html?pagewanted=1">Doonesbury</a>. But the Newton&#8217;s <em>print</em> recognition quickly got pretty darn good. I had a MessagePad 130, and later a Palm OS Handspring Visor. The print recognition on my MessagePad was just as good as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)">Graffiti recognition</a> on my Visor &#8212; without any requirement to learn a new notation system. What never worked reliably for me on the Newton was <em>cursive</em> handwriting recognition. It was amazing that it worked at all, and surely Apple put a ton of work into it. But it wasn&#8217;t good enough to ship, and they included it anyway. I think the Newton would have had a <em>better</em> reputation for handwriting recognition if it had done <em>less</em>, by only accepting print notation.</p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of Apple under Jobs is that they tend to ship only features that work great, even if that leaves many features not there at all. (Exhibit A: copy-and-paste in the iPhone OS.)</p>

<p>The iPhone&#8217;s design is governed by practical concerns. What are you expected to do with an iPhone or iPod Touch? Just look at the bottom of the home screen, in the app dock: phone calls, email, web surfing, movies, music. That&#8217;s what you do with an iPhone. Those are things people find exciting and fun.</p>

<p>What could you do with a Newton? Notes, calendars, contacts. All of the Newton&#8217;s primary features are mere secondary features on the iPhone. Worse, the Newton lacked good syncing. The lack of good syncing oddly limited the Newton to the scope of a paper notebook/organizer &#8212; an island unto itself, rather than acting as a client to data primarily stored elsewhere. Not so for the Palm Pilot (especially on Windows, where Palm&#8217;s syncing software was much better). The relationship of a Palm Pilot to your computer was crystal clear &#8212; it was a pocket-size device that synced to your computer as a peripheral. The relationship of a Newton to your Mac or PC was nebulous. And it was portable, but most definitely not pocketable.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve long harbored this theory that, out of hubris, Apple&#8217;s Newton team purposely designed the Newton more as a standalone system than a peripheral for Macs and PCs &#8212; in much the same way that the original Mac had no compatibility (or even similarity) with the then wildly-popular Apple II. The Newton was Apple&#8217;s Next Big Thing and they didn&#8217;t want to position it as a subservient satellite device that revolved around a Mac or Windows PC. Such hubris isn&#8217;t necessarily wrong or inherently doomed. It worked out well for the Macintosh, for example. But it&#8217;s risky &#8212; they bet big, went for broke, and lost it all.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s eyebrow-raising that &#8220;too big&#8221; and &#8220;too expensive&#8221; were the major knocks against the Newton, and here we are facing the arrival of the mythical Tablet, which, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703580904574638630584151614.html">according to the Wall Street Journal</a>, has a big 10-inch diagonal screen and will cost around $1,000. But I&#8217;d argue that the Newton wasn&#8217;t too big, too expensive, <em>period</em> &#8212; I&#8217;d say it was too big and too expensive <em>given what it offered</em>. That&#8217;s why Palm succeeded where the Newton failed. Apple went for &#8220;tablet computer&#8221; but only had features worthy of a handheld peripheral.</p>

<p>The difference between success and failure is almost never just one factor. It&#8217;s the balance between many factors. The tradeoffs. Palm made much smarter tradeoffs with the Pilot than Apple did with the Newton.</p>

<p>Today, though, no company makes better tradeoffs than Apple. And you certainly can&#8217;t argue that Apple, today, doesn&#8217;t understand the differences between portability and pocket-ability.</p>

<p>A few follow-up points speculating on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/the_tablet">The Tablet</a>.</p>

<h2>The App Store</h2>

<p>The most-asked question from readers was whether I expect The Tablet to be a tightly-controlled software platform like the iPhone. No one doubts that there will be <em>an</em> App Store for any possible Apple tablet computer &#8212; either a new branch of apps specifically designed for the tablet (as I expect), or iPhone OS apps modified to run on larger displays, or both. The question from readers is whether I expect the App Store will be, as on the iPhone, the <em>only</em> way to write native third-party software for the device.</p>

<p>To me this is so obvious, I didn&#8217;t consider it worth addressing. I say: yes, of course the App Store will be the only avenue for native third-party tablet apps. (&#8220;Native&#8221; as opposed to web apps, which by definition are wide open.) Whatever the problems and complaints developers have about the iPhone App Store, Apple clearly sees it as a huge win. They love the experience it provides, they love the control, and I&#8217;m sure they enjoy the 30 percent cut of the revenue.</p>

<h2>What If There Is No SDK on Day One?</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s out of the question that we could see a replay of the iPhone third-party app story, where the SDK is not available until months after the device debuts. Apple-quality SDKs take a lot of time and planning to produce. As with the iPhone, the product could be good enough to ship to users long before the APIs are solid enough to ship to developers. I don&#8217;t think it would be tenable for Apple not to even comment on the SDK prospects this time, though. If you thought there was an uproar with &#8220;just write web apps for it&#8221; in 2007, it&#8217;d be far louder this time.</p>

<h2>Non-App Indie iTunes Content</h2>

<p>But here&#8217;s another question re: the iTunes Store and The Tablet. Everyone, me included, presumes that a big part of The Tablet is going to involve e-reader features &#8212; some sort of thing where you can subscribe to newspapers and magazines and buy books through iTunes.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say that&#8217;s true. My question here is whether it&#8217;ll be (a) like the current iTunes Store for music and video, where the content comes only from major corporate media companies, or (b) like the App Store, where anyone can sign up to be a provider. For that matter, why <em>not</em> let indie bands and filmmakers sign up to sell the music and movies through iTunes?</p>

<p>Amazon lets you self-publish e-books through the Kindle store, but <a href="http://forums.digitaltextplatform.com/dtpforums/entry.jspa?externalID=2&amp;categoryID=12">they take the fat side of a 65-35 split</a>. If there were an iTunes book store where Apple took only the thin side of a 70-30 split (as they do with the App Store), I&#8217;ll bet it wouldn&#8217;t take long for Amazon to sweeten their deal.</p>

<h2>Flash</h2>

<p>What about Flash? Lots of people are speculating that The Tablet will run an updated version of iPhone OS. If that&#8217;s true, then it almost certainly won&#8217;t support Flash. Me? I think The Tablet is going to be running its own Whatever-the-Name-of-the-Tablet-Is OS &#8212; but if I had to bet, I&#8217;d bet on it not supporting Flash, either.</p>

<p>Why? For most of the same reasons why <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/02/flash_iphone_calculus">I don&#8217;t expect the iPhone OS ever to support Flash</a>. Flash is the leading cause of application crashes on Mac OS X. It is buggy. It&#8217;s inefficient. Presumably The Tablet is going to have a faster CPU and more RAM than an iPhone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean Apple is going to treat CPU cycles and memory as any less precious than they do on the iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/02/flash_iphone_calculus">As I wrote in February 2008</a>, correctly predicting that Apple would not be adding Flash support to iPhone OS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As it stands today, Apple is dependent on no one other than itself
  for the software on the iPhone. Apple controls the source code to
  the whole thing, from top to bottom. Why cede any of that control
  to Adobe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a footnote, I added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google and Yahoo provide Apple with web services for things like
  Maps, Stocks, and Weather. But that’s data, not software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my knowledge, Apple controls the entire source code to the iPhone OS. That&#8217;s not to say they wrote the whole thing from scratch. Many low-level OS components are open source. But they have the source. If there&#8217;s a bug, they can fix it. If something is slow, they can optimize or re-write it. That is not true for Mac OS X, and Flash is a prime example. The single leading source of application crashes on Mac OS X is a component that Apple can&#8217;t fix.</p>

<p>Yes, there&#8217;s demand for Flash. Yes, if The Tablet ships without Flash, there will be complaints. But the iPhone&#8217;s utter lack of support for Flash hasn&#8217;t exactly hurt it. (The same goes for Java, as well, but no one really complains about Java&#8217;s absence from the iPhone.)</p>

<p>If The Tablet ships without Flash and it proves to be a mistake, Apple can always add it later. But if The Tablet does ship with Flash and <em>that</em> proves to be a mistake, it&#8217;d be untenable for Apple to subsequently remove it.</p>

<summary type="html">If you&apos;re thinking The Tablet is just a big iPhone, or just Apple&apos;s take on the e-reader, or just a media player, or *just* anything, I say you&apos;re thinking too small.</summary>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another former Apple executive who was there at the time said the
  tablets kept getting shelved at Apple because Mr. Jobs, whose
  incisive critiques are often memorable, asked, in essence, what they
  were good for besides surfing the Web in the bathroom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>&#8212;&#8221;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/technology/05tablet.html">Just a Touch Away, the Elusive Tablet PC</a>&#8221;, The New York Times, 4 October 2009</em></p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thimbleful of information I have heard regarding The Tablet (none of which has changed in six months): The Tablet project is real, it has you-know-who&#8217;s considerable undivided attention, and everyone working on it has dropped off the map. I don&#8217;t know anyone who works at Apple who doubts these things; nor do I know anyone at Apple who knows a whit more. I don&#8217;t know anyone who&#8217;s seen the hardware or the software, nor even anyone who knows someone else who has seen the hardware or software.</p>

<p>The cone of silence surrounding the project is, so far as I can tell, complete.<sup id="fnr1-2009-12-31"><a href="#fn1-2009-12-31">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The situation is uncannily similar to the run-up preceding the debut of the original iPhone in January 2007, including many of the same engineers and software teams at Apple &#8212; such as those who built the iPhone Mail, Calendar, and Safari apps &#8212; disappearing into a black hole. The iPhone remained a secret until Steve Jobs took it out of his jeans pocket on stage at Macworld Expo. All of which is to say that what follows is my conjecture. Pure punditry, not one of those smarmy &#8220;predictions&#8221; where I know full well in advance what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>

<p>I have a thousand questions about The Tablet&#8217;s design. What size is it? There&#8217;s a big difference between, say, 7- and 10-inch displays. How do you type on it? With all your fingers, like a laptop keyboard? Or like an iPhone, with only your thumbs? If you&#8217;re supposed to watch video on it, how do you prop it up? Holding it in your hands? Flat on a table seems like the wrong angle entirely; but a fold-out &#8220;arm&#8221; to prop it up, à la a picture frame, seems clumsy and inelegant. If it&#8217;s just a touchscreen tablet, how do you protect the screen while carrying it around? If it folds up somehow, how is it not just a laptop &#8212; why not put a hardware keyboard on the part that folds up to cover the display? (Everyone I know at Apple refers to it as &#8220;The Tablet&#8221;, but so far as I can tell, that&#8217;s because that&#8217;s what everyone calls it, not because anyone knows that it actually even is, physically, a tablet. And &#8220;The Tablet&#8221; most certainly is not the product name.) If it&#8217;s too big to fit in a pants pocket, how are you supposed to carry it around? And but if it <em>does</em> fit in a pants pocket, how is it bigger enough than an iPod Touch to justify existing? And so on.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s one question at the top of the list, the answer to which is the key to answering every other question. That question is this: <em>If you already have an iPhone and a MacBook; why would you want this?</em></p>

<p>The epigraph I used to start this piece &#8212; the bit about Steve Jobs demanding that a tablet be useful for more than just reading on the can &#8212; indicates that Apple will release nothing without such an answer. I agree that such an answer is essential.</p>

<p>Successful new gadgets always seem to occupy a clearly defined place alongside, or replacing, existing devices. The Flip filled a previously empty niche for a small, cheap, simple video camera. How was the iPod better than existing portable music players? It fit 1,000 songs in your pocket, with a fun interface that let you find them easily. Why buy an iPhone to replace your existing mobile phone? Because there was a clear need for a modern handheld general-purpose computer.</p>

<p>But how much room is there between an iPhone (or iPod Touch) and a MacBook (or other laptop computer, running Windows or Linux or whatever)? What&#8217;s the argument for owning all three?</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;d use it on the couch and lying in bed&#8221;</em> is not a good answer. You can already use your iPhone <em>or</em> MacBook on the couch and in bed. It strikes me as foolish to market a multi-hundred-dollar device that people are expected to leave on their coffee table.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Kindle killer&#8221;</em> is not a good answer. If you think Apple is making a dedicated device for reading e-books and articles, you&#8217;re thinking too small. As profoundly reticent as Steve Jobs is regarding future Apple products, when he does speak, he&#8217;s often surprisingly revealing. <a href="http://kottke.org/09/10/one-handed-computing-with-the-iphone">David Pogue asked him about the Kindle</a> a few months ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A couple of years ago, pre-Kindle, Mr. Jobs expressed his doubts
  that e-readers were ready for prime time. So today, I asked if his
  opinions have changed.</p>
  
  <p>“I’m sure there will always be dedicated devices, and they may have
  a few advantages in doing just one thing,” he said. “But I think the
  general-purpose devices will win the day. Because I think people
  just probably aren’t willing to pay for a dedicated device.”</p>
  
  <p>He said that Apple doesn’t see e-books as a big market at this
  point, and pointed out that Amazon.com, for example, doesn’t ever
  say how many Kindles it sells. “Usually, if they sell a lot of
  something, you want to tell everybody.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, this is the same Steve Jobs who back in January 2008 <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/the-passion-of-steve-jobs/?ex=1358226000&amp;en=dc35254b0fcd5490&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">told The New York Times&#8217;s John Markoff</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It doesn’t matter how good or bad the product is, the fact is
  that people don’t read anymore,” he said. “Forty percent of the
  people in the U.S. read one book or less last year. The whole
  conception is flawed at the top because people don’t read anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could reasonably argue that the &#8220;people don&#8217;t read&#8221; comment, taken at face value, suggests that Apple has no interest in that market, period. </p>

<p>I, however, would square the two remarks as follows: Not enough people read to make it worth creating a dedicated device that is to reading what the original iPod was to music. (Everyone, for practical definitions of &#8220;everyone&#8221;, listens to music.) But e-reading as one aspect among several for a general-purpose computing device &#8212; well, that&#8217;s something else entirely.</p>

<p>The pre-Touch iPod was (and remains) an enormous success. It changed the music industry and rejuvenated Apple. But it was and remains a dedicated device; originally focused on audio, now capable of the sibling feature of video.</p>

<p>The iPhone, on the other hand, was conceived and has flourished as a general-purpose handheld computing platform. It was not introduced as such publicly, and is not pitched as such in Apple&#8217;s marketing, but clearly that&#8217;s what it is. The iPhone was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASkis57blsc#t=1m20s">described by Jobs in his on-stage introduction as three devices in one</a>: &#8220;a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, a breakthrough Internet communicator&#8221;. Thus, it was clear what people would want to do with it: watch videos, listen to music, make phone calls, surf the web, do email.</p>

<p>The way Apple made one device that did a credible job of all these widely-varying features was by making it a general-purpose computer with minimal specificity in the hardware and maximal specificity in the software. And, now, through the App Store and third-party developers, it does much more: serving as everything from a game player to a medical device.</p>

<p>Do I think The Tablet is an e-reader? A video player? A web browser? A document viewer? It&#8217;s not a matter of <em>or</em> but rather <em>and</em>. I say it is all of these things. It&#8217;s a computer.</p>

<p>And so in answer to my central question, regarding why buy The Tablet if you already have an iPhone and a MacBook, my best guess is that ultimately, The Tablet is something you&#8217;ll buy <em>instead</em> of a MacBook.</p>

<p>I say they&#8217;re swinging big &#8212; redefining the experience of personal computing.</p>

<p>It will not be pitched as such by Apple. It will be defined by three or four of its built-in primary apps. But long-term, big-picture? It will be to the MacBook what the Macintosh was to the Apple II.</p>

<p>I am not predicting that Apple is phasing out the Mac. (On the contrary, I&#8217;ve heard that Mac OS X 10.7 is on pace for a developer release at WWDC in June.) Like all Apple products, The Tablet will do less than we expect but the things it does do, it will do insanely well. It will offer a fraction of the functionality of a MacBook &#8212; but that fraction will be way more fun. The same myopic feature-checklist-obsessed critics who dismissed the iPhone will focus on all that The Tablet <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> do and declare that this time, Apple really has fucked up but good. The rest of us will get in line to buy one.</p>

<p>The Mac is, and will remain, Apple&#8217;s answer to what you use to do everything.</p>

<p>The Tablet, I say, is going to be Apple&#8217;s new answer to what you use for personal portable general computing.</p>

<p>Put another way, let&#8217;s say instead of a MacBook and an iPhone, you&#8217;ve got an iMac and an iPhone, but you also want a portable secondary computer. Today, that portable from Apple (<em>portable</em> as opposed to the iPhone&#8217;s <em>mobile</em>) is a MacBook. With The Tablet, you&#8217;ll have the option of a device that will more closely resemble the iPhone than the iMac in terms of concept and the degree of technical abstraction.</p>

<h2>The Tablet OS</h2>

<p>The original 1984 Mac didn&#8217;t abstract away the computer &#8212; it made the computer itself elegant, simple, and understandable. Very, very little was hidden from the typical user. Mac OS X is vastly more complex technically and conceptually, as it must be due to the vastly increased complexity and capability of today&#8217;s hardware. But Mac OS X has always tried to have it both ways: a veneer of simplicity that doesn&#8217;t cover the entire surface of the system. The user-exposed file system is a prime example. On the 1984 Mac, the entire file system was exposed, but the entire file system fit on a 400 KB floppy disk. On Mac OS X, the <em>/System/Library/</em> folder, one of many exposed fiddly sections of the file system browsable in the Finder, contains over 90,000 items, not one of which a typical user should ever need to see or touch.</p>

<p>The iPhone OS offers a complete computing abstraction. Under the hood, it&#8217;s just as complex as Mac OS X. On the surface, though, it is even more simple and elegant than the original Mac. No technical complexity is exposed. <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2009/10/11/flatland/">Hierarchy</a> is minimized. It relegates the file system to a developer-level technology rather than a user-level technology. (Did you know the file system on iPhones is case sensitive?)</p>

<p>But so while I think The Tablet&#8217;s OS will be <em>like</em> the iPhone OS, I don&#8217;t think it will <em>be</em> the iPhone OS. Carved from the same OS X core, yes, but with a new bespoke UI designed to be <em>just right</em> for The Tablet&#8217;s form factor, whatever that form factor will be.</p>

<p>One common prediction I disagree with is that The Tablet will simply be more or less an iPod Touch with a much bigger display. But in the same way that it made no sense for Apple to design the iPhone OS to run Mac software, it makes little sense for a device with a 7-inch (let alone larger) display to run software designed for a 3.5-inch display.</p>

<p>The iPhone OS user interface was not designed in the abstract. It&#8217;s entirely about real-world usability, and very much designed specifically around the physical size of the device itself. The size and spacing of tappable targets are designed with the size of human thumb- and fingertips in mind. More importantly, the whole thing is designed so that it can be <a href="http://kottke.org/09/10/one-handed-computing-with-the-iphone">used one-handed</a>. Even an adult with relatively small hands can go from one corner to the other with their thumb, holding the iPhone in one hand.</p>

<p>Mac OS X apps couldn&#8217;t run on an iPhone display because they simply wouldn&#8217;t fit, and the parts that did fit would contain buttons and other UI elements that were far too small to be used. Running iPhone software on a much larger display presents the opposite problem: it&#8217;s not that the UI couldn&#8217;t be scaled to fill the screen, it&#8217;s that it would be a waste to do so.</p>

<p>A 7-inch display isn&#8217;t twice the size of an iPhone&#8217;s, it&#8217;s <em>four</em> times bigger in surface area. I&#8217;m not sure even Shaquille O&#8217;Neal could hold a 7-inch iPod Touch in one hand and swipe from corner to corner with his thumb. Why would Apple stretch a UI designed to afford for one-handed use on 3.5-inch displays to cover a 7-inch (or larger) display that couldn&#8217;t possibly be used one-handed? If Apple&#8217;s starting with a hardware size where the iPhone OS can&#8217;t be used one-handed, then trust me, they&#8217;re designing a new interaction model.</p>

<p>Apple is not in the business of making monolithic OSes that they cram down your throat on as many widely-varying devices as possible. Apple is in the business of making complete products, for which they craft derivative OSes to fit each product. There is a shared core OS. There is not a shared core UI.<sup id="fnr2-2009-12-31"><a href="#fn2-2009-12-31">2</a></sup></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking The Tablet is just a big iPhone, or just Apple&#8217;s take on the e-reader, or just a media player, or <em>just</em> anything, I say you&#8217;re thinking too small &#8212; the equivalent of thinking that the iPhone was going to be <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/01/macworld_expo_predictions">just a click wheel iPod that made phone calls</a>. I think The Tablet is nothing short of Apple&#8217;s reconception of personal computing.</p>

<p>The only known breakage of the cone of silence around Apple&#8217;s tablet project I&#8217;m aware of are the meetings Apple has held with publishing industry executives. The way these meetings work, from what I&#8217;ve gathered, is as follows. Apple brings no hardware. They bring no software. They show no mockups. They do not even completely acknowledge that they&#8217;re making a new device. The people from Apple simply say something along the lines of, &#8220;If we were to create a new platform for book/magazine/newspaper content, would you be interested in offering your content for it?&#8221; Apple is, without any question in my mind, courting book and periodical publishers. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Apple trusts any of them enough to reveal or describe in detail what it is they&#8217;re actually working on.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2009-12-31"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>That said, I would not be surprised to find out that The Tablet uses UIKit, a.k.a. Cocoa Touch, as its programming API. I don&#8217;t think the same <em>apps</em> will run as-is on both OSes, but I do think you might use the same set of APIs to write apps for both platforms. (Or, perhaps iPhone apps could run as less-than-full-screen widgets on the larger tablet display.)&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2009-12-31"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<summary type="html">Web browsers should only buffer HTML5 media content when the `autobuffer` attribute has been explicitly turned on in the markup.</summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>[<strong>Update, 22 Dec 2009:</strong> In the original version of this article, I incorrectly reported that Firefox auto-buffers HTML5 video content by default, as Safari and Chrome do. It does not, as shown by <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/12/autobuffering-video-in-firefox/">Christopher Blizzard&#8217;s simple tests here</a>. I regret the error, and have revised the article accordingly. For posterity, the <a href="/misc/2009/12/html5_video_unusable.original.text">source for the original version is preserved here</a>. You can create a precise list of changes by doing a diff against the <a href="/2009/12/html5_video_unusable.text">source for the current revision</a>.]</p>

<p>I seldom post video to DF, but when I do, I refuse to embed Flash,<sup id="fnr1-2009-12-21"><a href="#fn1-2009-12-21">1</a></sup> I want the markup to be sane and standard, I want the video to play in popular standards-compliant web browsers, and I don&#8217;t want the video to download/buffer automatically. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/04/big_fan">Here&#8217;s an example from a year ago</a>, using QuickTime.</p>

<p>What you see upon page load is a poster frame (a still image), then you (the user) click the poster frame to actually download and watch the video. Here&#8217;s the markup I used then:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;embed
   width="320" height="256"
   type="video/quicktime"
   pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/"
   src="dtk-panic-1-poster.jpg"
   href="dtk-panic-1.mov"
   target="myself"
   controller="false"
   autoplay="false"
   scale="aspect"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That markup met all of my aforementioned desires but for one: the <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> tag is not standard. Worse, it now has a new significant problem: it doesn&#8217;t work at all in Chrome (at least on the Mac).</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/ffmpeg2theora">paying attention</a> to the new <a href="http://html5doctor.com/the-video-element/"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element in HTML5</a>. In a nut, it attempts to make embedding a video in a web page just as easy markup-wise as embedding an image with the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. (Likewise for audio with the new <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element.)</p>

<p>The obvious downside to relying solely on the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element to embed web video is that because it&#8217;s new, the only browsers that support it are recent releases of Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. This isn&#8217;t one of those things that just doesn&#8217;t work in IE6 or IE7 &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t work in IE <em>period</em>. Therefore few sites are using HTML5 video in production now, and of those, nearly all are doing so with <a href="http://henriksjokvist.net/archive/2009/2/using-the-html5-video-tag-with-a-flash-fallback">fallback markup</a>, often of <a href="http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody">significant complexity</a>, that presents the video using a Flash player for other browsers. Because (a) I don&#8217;t post much video; (b) the overwhelming majority of DF&#8217;s audience is in fact using an HTML5-compatible version of Safari, Firefox, or Chrome;<sup id="fnr2-2009-12-21"><a href="#fn2-2009-12-21">2</a></sup> and (c) I&#8217;m willing to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/06/30/ff5">be a dick</a> about this; I do not care about fallbacks for browsers that don&#8217;t support <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;d like to do is just use <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, with two source elements &#8212; MP4 and OGV &#8212; for all the cross-browser reasons specified in <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s fine chapter on video</a> in his in-progress HTML5 book. (Short version: Safari and MobileSafari support only MP4, Firefox supports only OGV, Chrome supports both MP4 and OGV.)<sup id="fnr3-2009-12-21"><a href="#fn3-2009-12-21">3</a></sup></p>

<p>So I decided to try this last week with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/misc/2009/12/user_guide_demos">the screencast videos</a> I created to illustrate my <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/pastrykit">piece on PastryKit</a>. I tried markup like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;video height="475"  width="407"  controls  poster="iphoneguide-mac.png"&gt;
   &lt;source src="iphoneguide-mac.mp4" type="video/mp4" /&gt;
   &lt;source src="iphoneguide-mac.ogv" type="video/ogg" /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The good news:</strong> The above markup results in video that plays in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. It also works perfectly in MobileSafari on iPhone OS. Safari and Chrome play the MP4 video, Firefox plays the OGV. (Chrome supports both formats, and plays the one listed first. I want it to play the MP4 version because the video and audio are of noticeably superior quality.) That is the entirety of the necessary markup; if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the sort of nasty markup typically used to embed video, try a little View Source on a few web pages that embed video.</p>

<p><strong>The bad news:</strong> In two of the three browsers (Safari 4.0.4 and Chrome 4.0.249.43), with the above simple markup, the video content buffers automatically on page load. What I mean is that as soon as you load the web page, the browsers download the actual video files that are embedded. As stated at the outset, I don&#8217;t want that. Instead, on page load, I want the browser to render only the <em>poster</em> image, and load the video only after the user has clicked to initiate playback.</p>

<p>The HTML5 spec defines an <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#attr-media-autobuffer"><code>autobuffer</code> attribute for the video and other media elements</a> (bold emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>autobuffer</code> attribute is a boolean attribute. Its presence
  hints to the user agent that the author believes that the media
  element will likely be used, even though the element does not have
  an <code>autoplay</code> attribute. (The attribute has no effect if used in
  conjunction with the <code>autoplay</code> attribute, though including both
  is not an error.) <strong>This attribute may be ignored altogether.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firefox honors the <code>autobuffer</code> attribute. Omit the attribute from your markup, and video content will not auto-buffer in Firefox. Include it, and it will.</p>

<p>But alas, in my testing, Safari and Chrome take the spec up on the aforebolded offer to ignore this attribute. Even if you do not explicitly turn this attribute on, Safari and Chrome will still auto-buffer the content for your <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> (and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>) elements. There is no way to suppress this using HTML markup.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, &#8220;<em>Hey, but default auto-buffering sounds like a good feature, because that way users won&#8217;t have to wait as long for the video to be ready to play.</em>&#8221; I presume this sort of thinking is what led the Safari and Chrome teams to do this.</p>

<p>But this browser behavior is very much undesirable for both publishers and users in common contexts. Users loading the page over a slow connection, or a pay-by-the-megabyte metered connection (which is common with wireless networks), should not be forced to download a potentially large video every time they load the page. Likewise, publishers should not be forced to pay for the bandwidth to transmit videos that won&#8217;t be watched.</p>

<p>Think, in particular, of the nature of publishing embedded video on a weblog. I, the publisher, post an entry containing embedded video. That post may remain on my home page for a week. Regular readers may load the home page dozens of times during the period when the video appears on the page. With auto-buffering, they&#8217;re going to download the full video every time they load the page. Local caching may alleviate some of that, but for sites with high traffic and/or which frequently embed video, the difference is enormous.</p>

<p>This is why embedded video from YouTube, Vimeo, and all similar services works on a click-to-load basis. Auto-buffering is fine <em>as an optional attribute</em>, but for many (probably most) contexts, click-to-load is essential behavior.</p>

<p>But as far as I can see, there&#8217;s no way to get click-to-load video in Safari or Chrome using just a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element. The only workaround I could think of was to do something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the HTML markup, rather than a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element, instead use an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element with the intended poster frame.</li>
<li>Add an <code>onclick</code> JavaScript handler to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, which, when invoked, does some DOM jiggery-pokery to remove the just-clicked-upon <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element and replace it with a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element that sources the intended video files.</li>
</ol>

<p>And, in fact, that is exactly what I resorted to for my PastryKit videos. Do a View Source on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/misc/2009/12/user_guide_demos">that page</a> to see the solution. There goes the nice clean just-as-easy-to-include-a-video-as-an-image markup. (My sincere thanks to <a href="http://farukat.es/">Faruk Ateş</a> and <a href="http://paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a> for helping with the jiggery-pokery implementation.)</p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25267">This WebKit bug</a> filed back in April indicates I&#8217;m not the first person to stumble on this shortcoming. That&#8217;s about <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, but the principle is exactly the same. And the example cited in this bug report seems like a perfect scenario where everyone should agree that media content should not buffer automatically: a podcast archive page with an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element for every previous episode.</p>

<p>A big part of the appeal of the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements is that they should be easier to use. As it stands today, though, these elements are unusable in popular contexts without resorting to JavaScript DOM manipulation to effectively turn auto-buffering off.</p>

<p>I think the HTML5 spec should be changed such that the value of the <code>autobuffer</code> attribute must be respected. And even if the spec is not changed, web browsers should not choose to ignore it. Web browsers should only buffer HTML5 media content when the <code>autobuffer</code> or <code>autoplay</code> attribute has been explicitly turned on in the markup.</p>

<p>As for why I refuse to embed Flash, let me put it this way. I use and highly recommend ClickToFlash, which blocks all Flash content by default. Why would I publish content using a technology that I personally block by default? I truly hope to see Flash fade as the de facto standard for embedded web video, and I&#8217;m willing to put my markup where my mouth is.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2009-12-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>As of this writing, Daring Fireball <a href="http://twitter.com/daringfireball/status/6812496176">gets about twice as many page views from MobileSafari</a> as all versions of Internet Explorer combined on a typical weekday.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2009-12-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Having to include separate source elements of the same video content encoded in two different formats is indeed an inconvenience. Not so much the extra markup as the extra work producing and encoding the second video file. Even the short videos I created to illustrate my PastryKit piece took a few minutes each to encode. Relative to most computing tasks today, encoding video once is already painfully slow. Encoding it twice is a time sink no one needs. But that&#8217;s the way it stands.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr3-2009-12-21"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>A bit more regarding <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/pastrykit">PastryKit</a>, Apple&#8217;s web framework for creating iPhone web apps with a look and feel very close to that of native iPhone apps.</p>

<h2>Apple&#8217;s Various JavaScript Frameworks</h2>

<p>Jonathan &#8220;Wolf&#8221; Rentzsch posted <a href="http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/286536824/apples-myriad-javascript-frameworks">this terrific overview</a> of the known JavaScript frameworks in use by various teams at Apple today. Some are public. Others, like PastryKit, are not. There&#8217;s a bit of overlap between them; in particular, several of them are very much patterned after Cocoa, not just in terms of MVC, but right down to details like class names. (I hadn&#8217;t heard of <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/Webobjects-dev/2009/Nov/msg00296.html">Gianduia</a> before, but it <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=670244">seems very deep</a>. Apple&#8217;s online retail team is using it for things like the <a href="http://concierge.apple.com/geniusbar/R206">Genius Bar reservation system</a>.)</p>

<p>But PastryKit is the only one that&#8217;s specifically targeted at building native-style iPhone user interfaces. Of the others, one does seem closely related to PastryKit: <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/lp-and-extras/">TuneKit</a>, the now-public framework for building iTunes LP and iTunes Extras content bundles. About 40 percent of the code in PastryKit and TuneKit is identical (if you discount the difference between the &#8220;PK&#8221; and &#8220;TK&#8221; class name prefixes). DF reader <a href="http://gregsadetsky.com">Greg Sadetsky</a> emailed with the following comparison, after running the code through a prettifier to de-minimize it. First, this from PastryKit:</p>

<pre><code>const PKTransitionDefaults = {
    duration: 0.5, delay: 0,
    removesTargetUponCompletion: false,
    revertsToOriginalValues: false
};
const PKTransitionStyles = [
    "-webkit-transition-property", 
    "-webkit-transition-duration",
    "-webkit-transition-timing-function",
    "-webkit-transition-delay",
    "-webkit-transition"
];
</code></pre>

<p>And then this identical-but-for-the-PK/TK-prefixes bit from TunesKit:</p>

<pre><code>const TKTransitionDefaults = {
    duration: 0.5, delay: 0,
    removesTargetUponCompletion: false,
    revertsToOriginalValues: false
};
const TKTransitionStyles = [
    "-webkit-transition-property", 
    "-webkit-transition-duration",
    "-webkit-transition-timing-function",
    "-webkit-transition-delay",
    "-webkit-transition"
];
</code></pre>

<p>Et cetera. Either PastryKit and TuneKit are sibling projects, or they&#8217;re the work of the same person. (Also, <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2009/09/14/new-itunes-lp-and-extras-built-using-tunekit-framework-aimed-at-apple-tv/">Daniel Dilger found references to &#8220;PastryKit&#8221;</a> in the <em>Wall-E</em> iTunes Extras bundle back in September.)</p>

<h2>iDisk Help</h2>

<p>A few readers emailed to point out another instance of PastryKit in action: the help pages for the iDisk app for iPhone OS. If you have the iDisk app from the App Store installed, you can see this by tapping &#8220;Settings&#8221;, then &#8220;iDisk Help&#8221;. Looks just like the rest of the app, but there are a few tell-tale signs that it&#8217;s PastryKit running in a full-screen web view (e.g. tapping on the status bar doesn&#8217;t scroll to the top).</p>

<h2>Is PastryKit a Leftover From the Pre-SDK Days?</h2>

<p>One common question I&#8217;ve seen (for one example, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=997508">in this Hacker News thread</a>) is whether PastryKit could be a leftover from the “web apps are a really sweet solution to creating iPhone software” days. I&#8217;d say no. For one thing, there’s always been a user guide, and as I recall, the guide has always sort of basically followed the look-and-feel of a native app, but this current version for iPhone OS 3 is much better. In fact, if you set your user agent in Safari to MobileSafari 2 (rather than 3) and then load the <a href="http://help.apple.com/iphone/">User Guide</a> you get an older version from iPhone OS 2.0, and it is far less impressive technically. No scrolling magic, no iPhone-style blue gradients when highlighting selected list rows, etc. Further, PastryKit takes advantage of features in mobile WebKit that were only added in iPhone OS 3.0. PastryKit is new.</p>

<h2>Apple&#8217;s Take on Web Apps Competing With the App Store</h2>

<p>Lastly, there’s the question of how concerned Apple is, strategically, that a robust web app API and market would take away from the App Store. And if so, are they worried about the money? I&#8217;d guess probably not. I don&#8217;t think Apple&#8217;s 30 percent cut of App Store revenue is anything to sneeze at, and it&#8217;s growing fast. But there&#8217;s no question that the App Store exists to sell iPhones and iPod Touches, not the other way around.</p>

<p>A bigger concern might be the fact that web apps are cross-platform. Apple is currently using user-agent detection to prevent its PastryKit user guide apps from loading on anything other than MobileSafari, but I don&#8217;t think there’s any technical reason why these apps wouldn’t work just fine, and look almost the same, on both Android and WebOS. The font would be slightly different, since neither of those ship with Helvetica, but otherwise it’d look just like an iPhone app.</p>

<p>Cutting edge web development never seems to “just work” across different browsers, but these three &#8212; iPhone, Android, WebOS &#8212; are all based on the same WebKit rendering core. And even if per-platform tweaks are required, surely it’d be far less work than to develop separate native apps using the fundamentally different Cocoa Touch, Android, and <a href="http://developer.palm.com/">Mojo</a> APIs.</p>

<p>I would hope Apple isn&#8217;t concerned about this. For one thing, desktop-targeted web apps haven&#8217;t dampened demand for Macs. If anything, the Mac has <em>thrived</em> as the web has replaced Windows as the most widespread software platform. I think Apple would do well to encourage web apps for <em>cross-platform</em> mobile software, and that doing so would not slow interest in native Cocoa Touch development for performance (especially games) and access to hardware (like the camera) not available to web apps. I also think it would benefit both iPhone users and Apple itself to have no-approval-necessary web apps thrive as an alternative to the tightly-controlled App Store.<sup id="fnr1-2009-12-17"><a href="#fn1-2009-12-17">1</a></sup> It&#8217;s human nature to <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/12/16/iphone-developers-abandoning-app-model-for-html5/">emphasize conflict and drama</a>, but there&#8217;s no reason why native iPhone apps <em>and</em> iPhone-optimized web apps can&#8217;t both be thriving, growing platforms.</p>

<p>But, well, <a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/post/277830536/slightly-longer-version-of-a-tweet-from-this">we don&#8217;t know</a>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2009-12-17">
<p>That&#8217;s not to say more capable web app APIs would be a panacea for all that ails the App Store. For one thing, many of the apps that Apple has blocked from the App Store couldn&#8217;t technically be reproduced as web apps. Google Voice, to name the most infamous example. For another, it isn&#8217;t much solace to a developer who just created an entire working native iPhone app in Cocoa Touch to be told that their work will not be published in the App Store but that they&#8217;re free to recreate the app from scratch using entirely different APIs and technologies.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2009-12-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>
